# notebooks
This GitHub Repository stores my R Notebooks, which allows GitHub Pages to serve the R Notebooks on my website.  I was introduced to this idea on minimaxir's website (http://minimaxir.com/2017/06/r-notebooks/)  This allows me to avoid including a redundant, heavy index.html in every corresponding repository.  All the notebooks will be served from a /notebooks/ folder.  

Please refer to the original repository for each notebook where appropriate.
